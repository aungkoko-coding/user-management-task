# User Management Task

This application does not focus on a beautiful UI but emphasizes application logic and flow. It optimizes runtime performance, and minimizes API calls during user searches. Although I had not used Ant Design in any previous projects, I developed this application with that library.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Next, start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
